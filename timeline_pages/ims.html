            <p>This was the latest internsihp that I was able to do. I had the privelage to take part in Techpoint's Xtern program and work at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. I was able to work there through two major events at the IMS, those being the Indy 500 and Brickyard Weekend. I was also able to get a lot of hands on experience doing UX design in a professional setting and did professional level work.

            <h2>SCORE UI suggesstions</h2>
            <p>The first set of assignments that I had working at the IMS was to take a look at their proprietary Point-of-sale application called SCORE. I first got some hands on learning eperience on how the SCORE application worked and interviewed employees in the ticket office to find any issues with the current application and I used that experience to make some UI suggestions. I mocked up these changes in Figma and it was the first design project that I had. I included the link to the Figma mockups. The screenshots for the notes that I took on each page are in the Google Drive.

          <h2>IMS Promo Page Redesign</h2>
          <p>The second project that I worked on was a Redesign of the promotions page on the IMS website. I updated the main home page for the IMS promotions as well as the page for a promotion that the IMS ran for the Brickyard weekend.

          <h2>SeatMap Project</h2>
          <p>The largest project that I worked on during the summer was making design changes to the SeatMap platform that the IMS uses. Some background on the SeatMap platform. SeatMap, is a ticekting platform that is similar to other platforms like Ticketmaster. The IMS manages not only their own races but the INDYCAR races in Detroit and Iowa. The SeatMap platform itself was first used on the website for the Iowa INDYCAR race and the IMS planned to implement it for their own website aswell as the website for the Detroit Grand Prix. I was tasked with making some design suggesstions for the platform to make it compatible with the way tickets are sold at the IMS as well as bring it in line with contemporary ticket purchasing platforms. I made a lot of mockups in Figma and these were passed on to a developer to be implemented.

          <h2>Credentials E-mail Update</h2>
          <p>A minor project I was tasked with was to update the email that is sent to customers when they order credentials. The original layout of the email used a table and put the content in different cells. This resulted in there being grey lines that would show up on the edges of the page. I fixed this, as well as adding a new header to the page to add some color. A screenshot of the finished product is include in the Google Drive</p>
