    <h3>Database Information</h3>

    <p width="1000">
      I created the database by compiling the spending and performance for 15
      different Premier League teams for the last 5 years. A requirement to be
      included has to have been in the Premier League for at least one season in
      the last 5 seasons, not including the current 2022-23 season (17- 18
      season to the 21-22 season). I also decided to pick the top 15 biggest
      spenders over the course of these seasons. The fields are position,
      transfer In, transfer out, and transfer total. Position is their position
      in the premier league, if the team was in the Championship, twenty (20)
      will be added to the position they were in, as there are 20 teams in the
      Premier League. Teams in position 18-20 were relegated in that season to
      the Championship, teams in position 21 and 22 were promoted to the premier
      league, and teams in the 23-26 position were in the promotion playoff.
      Transfer in is the money spent on players, transfer out is money gained
      from selling players and transfer total is the difference between in and
      out.

    <h3>Visual Information</h3>
    <p>
      When it comes to early concepts, I initially wanted to make a scatterplot,
      but latter in the project, I realized that a bar chat would work a lot
      better for what I wanted to do. As for why I thought a bar chart would be
      better, bar charts make it easier to directly compare two values. I wanted
      to create a chart that would sort by year, transfer type, and I wanted to
      also sort the y-axis, by position or alphabetically, but I couldn't get it
      to work. One piece of information that I found was that teams that get
      promoted from the Championship to the Premier League tend to spend a lot
      of money the season after they get promoted.
